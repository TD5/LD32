My entry for Ludum Dare 32 - An Unconventional Weapon

Current game idea:
Program a drone to defend against the evil attackers. There's no direct control, only the forward-thinking and logic you feed into your program - *this* is your real weapon.

Currently written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), using Vim, Elm Reactor and Safari.
